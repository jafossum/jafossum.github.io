Well. Lets get started.

My original idea was really to just start putting together bits and pieces for my ambitious drone
project. This of course resulted in using GitHub and BitBucket for source control. Doing this i noticed
that both of these services can host a free blog based static HTML page. Since I know nothing
about writing HTML this was not really something I wanted to get into. But after looking a bit
into [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) came to the rescue!!

And here we are!

I tested aroung with the basic Jekyl setup and was really surpriced on how easy it was to get started
with a blog using jekyll. So why not try documenting some of my quests with a blog?

### Now let's choose a theme

I looked aroung for some theme for my blog, since I did not want to just use the default Jekyll theme.
So i found the HPSTR Theme from [jekkylthemes.com](http://jekyllthemes.org/), and from there I must say
it got to be a steap learning curve, but I really like this theme. And after struggeling a bit to put
it together I finally have something that looks like a blog?!
