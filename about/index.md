### This was not really the plan, but here we go.

My name is John A. Fossum, and I live in Trondheim, Norway together with
my girlfriend and our two kids. But since this is suposed to be kind of a geeky blog, lets get to it...

For the last few years I have been talking about
starting up my own quad copter drone project using Arduino, RaspberryPi and my own control algorithms.

And this is where the whole story starts.

I have a M.Sc in Cybernetics from NTNU un Trondheim Norway, and have a broad experience in developing
various industrial controlsystems ranging from low level PLC programmming, to high level systems developed
mainly in Python, C# and ASP.Net among other things.

So why this drone idea?

from my Cybernetics degree I have an extensive theoretical base for putting together the physical mathematical
models for understanding and controlloing differnet physical systems, such as a drone.
The only problem is that I have never utilized this knowlegde in my professional life, and because of this
all this knowlege seems lost... So the solution seems to be getting into this on my own spare time.

So here we go....
